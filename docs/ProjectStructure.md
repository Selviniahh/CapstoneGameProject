### **Main.cpp**
- Initializes the `GameManager` and calls its `Update` and `Draw` methods.
- Ensures the thread sleeps when the window is unfocused to prevent crashes.

### **GameManager**
- The `GameManager` class is the core of the project. All game objectsâ€™ `Initialize`, `Update`, and `Draw` methods are managed here.
- Enemies, guns, levels, and other game elements must be initialized through the **GameManager**.

### **Globals**
- Global variables like `FrameTick` and `ScreenSize`, as well as relevant operator overloads, are defined here for universal access.

### **Input Manager**
- Calculates movement direction using the **W/A/S/D** keyboard inputs.
- Handles camera zoom (via **E/Q**), unzoom, and movement (using **arrow keys**).
